                <br>
                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                The Mighty Adam serves as Egypt's champion for many centuries but becomes corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter Blaze in disguise.

                <h1>PLOT</h1>
                In ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed, and Black Adam has gone from man to myth to legend. Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone.
                <br>
                <H1>CAST</H1>
                Dwayne Johnson as Teth-Adam / Black Adam:
                A former slave from Kahndaq who was bestowed with the powers of multiple Egyptian gods by his son after he was mortally wounded by king Ahk-Ton's soldiers. He possesses "the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru, the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of Aten, and the courage of Mehen". Benjamin Patterson serves as the body double for Teth-Adam in scenes where he is depicted in his human form, while Johnson's face was superimposed onto the character for these sequences. The character previously appeared in Shazam! (2019) in a brief cameo, during a sequence where The Wizard teaches Billy Batson about the previous recipients of his powers.[7] Johnson also voiced the character in a post-credits cameo, ahead of the character's live-action debut, in the unrelated animated film DC League of Super-Pets (2022), in which he also voiced Krypto.[8][9]
                Aldis Hodge as Carter Hall / Hawkman: The leader of the Justice Society who wields technology and weapons made of Nth metal, a substance from another planet.[10][11][12]
                Noah Centineo as Albert "Al" Rothstein / Atom Smasher: A young member of the Justice Society, with the metahuman ability to control his molecular structure which manipulates his size and strength.[13][9][14]
                Sarah Shahi as Adrianna Tomaz: A university professor and resistance fighter in modern-day Kahndaq, who proves to be an ally for Adam and the Justice Society.[15]
                Marwan Kenzari as Ishmael Gregor / Sabbac:
                The last descendant of King Ahk-Ton and militant leader of the Kahndaq division of the criminal organization Intergang. Unlike Teth-Adam, Sabbac was bestowed with the powers of the six most powerful demons of Hell: Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, and Crateis.[16][17][18]
                Kenzari also portrays Ahk-Ton, Ishmael's ancestor and the ancient tyrannical king of Kahndaq, who was killed by Adam.
                Quintessa Swindell as Maxine Hunkel / Cyclone:
                A young member of the Justice Society, who was experimented on and injected with nanobot technology at a young age, resulting in her receiving the ability to control and manipulate wind.[19][14] As the granddaughter of Abigail "Ma" Hunkel / Red Tornado she seeks to live up to her familial superhero legacy.[20] Swindell studied dancing techniques when designing their character's movement.[21]
                Bodhi Sabongui as Amon Tomaz: Adrianna's teenage son, who befriends Adam.[22]
                Pierce Brosnan as Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate:
                An experienced and senior member of the Justice Society, who wields the Helmet of Fate and is capable of various sorcery abilities.[12] Nelson is the son of an archeologist, with whom he discovered the tomb of Nabu the Wise. After attaining a mystic-sentient helmet from another dimension, which chooses who it allows to wield it, he mastered his powers and used them as a superhero over many years.[23][14] Brosnan wore a motion capture suit for the role.[24]
                Additionally, Mohammed Amer portrays Karim, Adrianna's brother and Amon's uncle,[25][26] and James Cusati-Moyer portrays Samir, a colleague of Adrianna and Karim.[27] Jalon Christian appears as Hurut, Adam's son who becomes the original Champion of Kahndaq deemed pure of heart to wield the powers of Shazam, with his superhero form portrayed by Uli Latukefu.[28] Odelya Halevi portrays Shiruta, Adam's wife who was murdered by Ahk-Ton's men during the flashback scenes set in ancient Kahndaq.[29][14] Henry Winkler cameos as Al Pratt, Rothstein's uncle who was the previous Atom Smasher.[30]
                
                Djimon Hounsou reprises his role from Shazam! as the wizard Shazam,[12][31] and Jennifer Holland reprises her role from The Suicide Squad (2021) and Peacemaker (2022) as Emilia Harcourt.[32] Viola Davis and Henry Cavill appear uncredited, reprising their respective DCEU roles as Amanda Waller[33] and Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman.[34][35] This was Cavill's final performance as Superman before it was announced that he would step down from the role.[36]
                
                The demons Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, and Crateis also appear in this film and are voiced by uncredited actors.[
